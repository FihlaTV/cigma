Verify that the following points are discussed in the manual:

  - Cigma does not include a mesh generation package, so in order
    to have greater accuracy in the comparisons one needs to increase
    order of the integration rule being used.

  - Meshes are internally stored as unstructured meshes.

  - That we can only compare Fields on a single ElementBlock at a time.

Things to check for the release:

  - Files
    * Make sure the tarball has all the required files
    * Check for the proper /doc/ files
    * Check for the proper /examples/ files
    * Check that all required data files are included (see /tests/data/ directory)
    * Check that 'make check' works

  - Installation procedures
    * Create tarball with 'make dist' and test it
    * Use custom boost installation on ~/opt/boost
    * Use custom hdf5 installation on ~/opt/hdf5
    * Use custom vtk installation on ~/opt/vtk

  - Consistency checks
    * comparing one and zero on brick{1,2} meshes (should give volume)
    * comparing test.brick and zero on brick{1,2} meshes (should give known answer)
    * comparing test.square and zero on brick{1,2} meshes (should give known answer)

  - Integration rules
    * Increase order of integration rule instead of mesh refinement (check convergence)

  - Examples
    * comparing laplace solutions
    * comparing citcomcu solutions
    * comparing conman solutions (see blankenbach)
    * comparing gale solutions
    * comparing pylith solutions
    * comparing geofest solutions
