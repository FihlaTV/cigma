\begin_layout Section
About Cigma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CIG Model Analyzer (Cigma) consists of a suite of tools for comparing
 numerical models.
 CIG has developed Cigma in response to demand from the short-term tectonics
 community for a simple tool that can perform rigorous error analysis on
 their finite element codes.
 The long-term goal for Cigma, however, is for it to be used for nearly
 all geodynamics modeling codes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current version of Cigma is intended for the calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 residuals for finite element models.
 This software was designed for performing the following three main tasks:
 (1) error analysis, (2) benchmarking, and (3) code verification.
 In error analysis, Cigma can calculate a global measure of the error between
 two solutions by performing an integration over a discretized version of
 the common domain.
 This comparison can take place even when the underlying discretizations
 do not overlap.
 In benchmarking, Cigma can help the geodynamics community agree on a standard
 solution to specific problems by facilitating the process of comparing
 different numerical codes against each other.
 Lastly, as an automated tool, Cigma can help application developers create
 regression tests to ensure that software changes do not affect the consistency
 of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At its core, Cigma draws from a variety of libraries.
 The 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl
name "FInite element Automatic Tabulator (FIAT)"
target "www.fenics.org/wiki/FIAT"

\end_inset

 Python Library supports generation of arbitrary order instances of the
 Lagrange elements on lines, triangles, and tetrahedra.
 It can also generate higher order instances of Jacobi-type quadrature rules
 on the same element shapes.
 The 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl
name "Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)"
target "www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/"

\end_inset

 Library, written in C++, supports data structures and algorithms for both
 exact and nearest-neighbor searching in arbitrarily high dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these libraries extend and generalize Cigma's functionality so it
 can handle other types of elements, and provide the ability to compare
 vector fields.

Error Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When studying differential equations that represent physical systems we
 often obtain solutions by using a variety of techniques.
 Solving these equations using classical analytical methods is almost impossible
, so we often resort to numerical algorithms such as the finite element
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For assessing the quality of the solution to our equations, it is important
 to quantify the error in our numerical solutions.
 To calculate this error, we will have to compare these solutions against
 each other through the use of a distance measure between two functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Distance Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest possible quantitative measure of the difference between two
 distinct functions consists of taking the pointwise difference at a common
 set of points.
 While no finite sample of points can perfectly represent a continuum of
 values, valuable information can be inferred from the statistics of the
 resulting set of differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XXX: motivate this measure..validation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very useful distance measure we can use is the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 norm, defined by the following integral
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\varepsilon=||u-v||_{L_{2}}=\sqrt{\int_{\Omega}||u(\vec{x})-v(\vec{x})||^{2}d\vec{x}}\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 are the two functions on a global coordinate system.
 This gives us a single global estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 representing the distance between the two fields 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, you may think of this as the size, or norm, of the residual
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\vec{x})=u(\vec{x})-v(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Global Error Approximation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we discretize the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 into an appropriate set of cells 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{1},\Omega_{2},\ldots,\Omega_{n_{el}}$
\end_inset

, we can compute the global error 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{2}$
\end_inset

 as a sum over localized cell contributions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{2}=\sum_{e}\varepsilon_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

, where each cell residual 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon_{e}^{2} & = & \int_{\Omega_{e}}||u(\vec{x})-v(\vec{x})||^{2}d\vec{x}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, we won't be able to integrate each cell residual 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 exactly since either of the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 may have an incompatible representation relative to the finite element
 space on each domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

.
 However, we can still calculate an approximation of each cell residual
 by applying an appropriate quadrature rule with a tolerable truncation
 error 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Encyclopaedia of Cubature Formulas 2005"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain an approximation to the integral of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

 over a cell 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

, we simply apply the quadrature rule with weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{e,1},w_{e,2},\ldots,w_{e,n_{Q}}$
\end_inset

 and integration points 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}_{e,1},\vec{x}_{e,2},\ldots,\vec{x}_{e,n_{Q}}$
\end_inset

 appropriate for the physical element 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\Omega_{e}}\ F(\vec{x})\ d\vec{x}=\sum_{q=1}^{n_{Q}}w_{e,q}F(\vec{x}_{e,q})\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applying this quadrature rule directly over the entire physical domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\cup\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

 gives us 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\Omega}\ F(\vec{x})\ d\vec{x}=\sum_{e=1}^{n_{el}}\sum_{q=1}^{n_{Q}}w_{e,q}F(\vec{x}_{e,q})\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For efficiency reasons, it is undesirable in finite element applications
 to perform calculations in a global coordinate system.
 To avoid duplication of work, shape function evaluations may be performed
 once on a reference cell 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Omega}$
\end_inset

 and then transformed back into the corresponding physical cell 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

 as needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compute integrals of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 in a reference coordinate system, we need to apply a change of variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\Omega_{e}}\ F(\vec{x})\ d\vec{x}=\int_{\hat{\Omega}}\ F(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}))J_{e}(\vec{\xi})\ d\vec{\xi}\]

\end_inset

where 
\color none
the additional factor 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{e}(\vec{\xi})=\det\left[\frac{d\vec{x}_{e}}{d\vec{\xi}}\right]$
\end_inset

 is the Jacobian determinant of the reference map 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}):\hat{\Omega}\to\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

.
 This map describes how the physical points 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}\in\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

 are transformed from the reference points 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\xi}\in\hat{\Omega}$
\end_inset

.
 Put another way, the inverse reference map 
\color inherit

\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\xi}=\vec{x}_{e}^{-1}(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

 tells us how the physical domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

 maps into the reference cell 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Omega}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, we can assume without loss of generality that every physical
 cell 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

 can be derived from a single reference cell 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Omega}$
\end_inset

, so that our quadrature rule becomes simply a set of weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1},\ldots,w_{n_{Q}}$
\end_inset

 and points 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\xi}_{1},\ldots,\vec{\xi}_{n_{Q}}$
\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Omega}$
\end_inset

.
 After changing variables, we end up with the final form of the quadrature
 rule that we can use to integrate the global residual field:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\hat{\Omega}}\ F(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}))J_{e}(\vec{\xi})\ d\vec{\xi}=\sum_{q=1}^{n_{Q}}w_{q}F(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}_{q}))J_{e}(\vec{\xi}_{q})\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we let 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\vec{x})=||u(\vec{x})-v(\vec{x})||^{2}$
\end_inset

 in the above expression, we can find the cell residual contribution over
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

 from
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon_{e}^{2} & = & \int_{\Omega_{e}}\ ||u(\vec{x})-v(\vec{x})||^{2}\ d\vec{x}\\
 & = & \int_{\hat{\Omega}}\ ||u(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}))-v(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}))||^{2}J_{e}(\vec{\xi})\ d\vec{\xi}\\
 & = & \sum_{q=1}^{\mathrm{n_{Q}}}w_{q}||u(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}_{q}))-v(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}_{q}))||^{2}J_{e}(\vec{\xi}_{q})\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The global error 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=\sqrt{\sum_{e}\varepsilon_{e}^{2}}$
\end_inset

 is then approximated by the expression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon & = & \sqrt{\sum_{e=1}^{\mathrm{n_{el}}}\sum_{q=1}^{\mathrm{n_{Q}}}w_{q}||u(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}_{q}))-v(\vec{x}_{e}(\vec{\xi}_{q}))||^{2}J_{e}(\vec{\xi}_{q})}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can make a number of observations based on our final expression for the
 global error, (XXX: add observations here).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Comparing Residuals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For comparing errors of different solutions, you can normalize the global
 error by the norm of the exact solution.
 For a family of solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{h}(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

, parametrized by the the maximum element size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 of the underlying discretization, and an exact solution 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

, this normalized error is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon_{rel} & = & \frac{||u-u^{h}||_{L_{2}}}{||u||_{L_{2}}}\\
 & = & \frac{\int_{\Omega}||u(\vec{x})-u^{h}(\vec{x})||^{2}d\vec{x}}{\int_{\Omega}||u(\vec{x})||^{2}d\vec{x}}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This normalized error can be interpreted as the average error in the physical
 quantity being evaluated, so that a value of 0.01 corresponds to a 1% averaged
 error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if the exact solution is not currently known, this normalized error
 may be used to test the accuracy between two or more numerical solutions,
 defined on successively refined meshes.

The default data storage format for Cigma is the Hierarchical Data Format
 (HDF5), a portable file format developed at the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl
name "National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)"
target "hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5"

\end_inset

.
 The HDF5 is designed for storing multi-dimensional arrays together with
 meta-data in a portable self-describing format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The underlying data storage format for Cigma is the HDF5 format, due to
 its flexibility for storing and organizing large amounts of data.
 The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is designed for storing, retrieving,
 analyzing, visualizing, and converting scientific data.
 It uses a hierarchical structure that provides application programmers
 with a host of options for organizing how data is stored in HDF5 files.
 Using HDF5 datasets in Cigma allows us to avoid having to convert between
 too many distinct formats.
 Moreover, due to the amount of disk I/O, large finite element meshes can
 be handled more efficiently in binary format.

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparing Two Finite Element Fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing two arbitrary finite element fields can be accomplished with the
 
\family typewriter
cigma compare
\family default
 command-line utility.
 By default, the comparison will take place over the elements in the mesh
 of the first field.
 Finally, the square of each of the local residual values are written to
 the specified VTK output file as cell-based scalars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A basic comparison can be as simple as specifying the following arguments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare --output=residuals.vtk
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\series bold
 
\series default
             --first=field1.h5:/field1/stepN
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\series bold
 
\series default
             --second=field2.h5:/field2/stepN
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparing against Known Values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A finite element description might not always be available for one of the
 fields.
 However, you can break the comparison into several steps if you have a
 means to compute that field on any of the required points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, extract the global coordinates of the integration points.
 This will result in an explicit list of points over which to evaluate your
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma extract --mesh=field1.h5:/model/mesh/
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              --output=points.h5:/projected_points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you can evaluate your function at the designated points.
 You can provide the path to the explicit set of values with
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare --output=residuals.vtk
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              --first=field1.h5:/field1/stepN

Comparing against a Known Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one of your fields is easily described by an analytic expression, then
 you also have the option to compile your analytic function into Cigma,
 which will enable the 
\family typewriter
compare
\family default
 command to reference your function by name.
 For example,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare --output=residuals.vtk
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\series bold
 
\series default
             --first=field1.h5:/vars/displacement/step0

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\series bold
 
\series default
             --second=
\bar under
disloc3d
\series bold
\bar default
 
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also interact with your analytic function by using the 
\family typewriter
cigma
\family default
 
\family typewriter
eval
\family default
 command, and obtain a set of values which may then be passed back to the
 
\family typewriter
compare
\family default
 command.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma eval --function=
\bar under
disloc3d
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
           --points=points.h5:/projected_points
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
           --values=values.h5:/disloc3d_values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once these values have been obtained, we can use it to resume the calculation
 of 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare --output=residuals.vtk
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              --first=field1.h5:/vars/displacement/step0
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              --second-points=points.h5:/projected_points
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              --second-values=values.h5:/disloc3d_values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another built-in function you might find useful is the 
\family typewriter
\bar under
zero
\family default
\bar default
 function, which is defined to return 0 everywhere.
 You can use this function for estimating the norm of your field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Specifying an Integration Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To override the mesh used in the integration, you can specify an extra argument
 providing the location of the mesh,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --quadrature-mesh=mesh.h5:/model/mesh/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, you can also specify the coordinates and connectivity arrays
 separately, in case they reside in separate files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --quadrature-mesh-coordinates=file1.h5:/model/mesh/coordinates
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --quadrature-mesh-connectivity=file2.h5:/model/mesh/connectivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Specifying a Quadrature Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To specify a quadrature rule, you will have to provide the quadrature weights
 and points in the appropriate reference element.
 This can be done with the following additional argument:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --quadrature-rule=quadrature-rules.h5:/path/to/rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also specify the location of the points and weights separately:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --quadrature-rule-points=file.h5:/path/to/rule/points
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --quadrature-rule-weights=file.h5:/path/to/rule/weights
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\family typewriter
src/
\family default
 directory of the Cigma distribution, you can find a Python script called
 
\family typewriter
rules.py
\family default
 that uses FIAT for calculating an appropriate set of quadrature rules for
 use in Cigma.

In this chapter we will use sample datasets from the strike-slip benchmark
 case defined by the CIG Short-Term Tectonics working group.
 In this benchmark problem, we solve for the viscoelastic relaxation of
 stresses from a single finite earthquake while ignoring gravity.
 The problem is defined on a cube domain with sides of 24 km consisting
 of two layers of different material types.
 The top layer of the cube is nearly elastic, while the bottom layer is
 viscoelastic.

\begin_layout Section
Convergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the exact solution of your equations is known, the norm of the error
 for a finite element solution is easily computed through the procedure
 given in Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:Error-Analysis"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way of checking the accuracy of a solution is by rerunning the same
 problem with a finer mesh.
 Recall that in the finite element method, the weight functions and trial
 solutions are chosen so that the finite element method is convergent.
 In other words, as the element size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 decreases, the solution tends to the correct solution.
 Thus, if the difference between the coarse and fine mesh solutions is small,
 we can conclude that the coarse mesh solution is quite accurate.
 However, if a solution changes noticeably with refinement of the mesh,
 the coarse mesh solution is inaccurate, and even the finer mesh may be
 inadequate as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen from these results, the log of the error varies linearly
 with element size and the slope depends on the order of the element.
 Denoting the slope by 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, then the error in the function can be expressed as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\log\varepsilon=\log C+\alpha\log h\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\log C$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary constant, the y-intercept of the curve.
 The slope 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the rate of convergence of the element.
 We can rewrite this as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\varepsilon=Ch^{\alpha}\]

\begin_layout Subsection
HDF5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HDF5 files are organized in a hierarchical structure, similar to a UNIX
 file system.
 Two types of primary objects, groups and datasets, are stored in this structure.
 A group contains instances of zero or more groups or datasets, while a
 dataset stores a multi-dimensional array of data elements.
 Both kinds of objects are accompanied by supporting metadata known as attribute
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dataset is physically stored in two parts: a header and a data array.
 The header contains miscellaneous metadata describing the dataset as well
 as information that is needed to interpret the array portion of the dataset.
 Essentially, it includes the name, datatype, dataspace, and storage layout
 of the dataset.
 The name is a text string identifying the dataset.
 The datatype describes the type of the data array elements.
 The dataspace defines the dimensionality of the dataset, i.e., the size and
 shape of the multi-dimensional array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Cigma you always provide an explicit path to every dataset, so you have
 a fair amount of flexibility for how you organize your datasets inside
 HDF5 files.
 For example, a typical Cigma HDF5 file could have the following structure.
\end_layout

Generally, Cigma will only require you to specify the path to a specific
 field dataset.
 If a small amount of metadata is present in your field dataset, the rest

 use, will be deduced from that metadata.
\end_layout

VTK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current version of Cigma only supports VTK unstructured grid datasets
 of a single element type.
 You can still compare various unstructured grids with different element
 types to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that while you typically provide a path (or name) for every dataset,
 this is not necessary when specifying a VTK mesh, since this data is taken
 from the special Points and Cells arrays, which you cannot rename.
 However, you will still need to provide a name when referring to the field
 coefficients, which are assumed to be stored as Point Data in the input
 VTK file.

 specified in the first line.
 For example, mesh coordinates can be specified in the following format
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
nno nsd
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
x1 y1 z1
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
x2 y2 z2
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
x3 y3 z3
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mesh connectivity with 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
nel ndofs
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
node_1 node_2 node_3 node_4 ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
node_1 node_2 node_3 node_4 ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
node_1 node_2 node_3 node_4 ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A generic field with 
\family typewriter
ndim
\family default
 components (i.e., scalar, vector, or tensor) is specified by
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
num ndim
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
f1 f2 f3 ..
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
f1 f2 f3 ..
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this last case, the number of rows could refer to either 
\family typewriter
nno
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
nel
\family default
, depending on whether the field is node-based or cell-based.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Output File Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output format for residuals consists simply of a list of scalars for
 each element in the discretization.
 If you specify a 
\family typewriter
.vtk
\family default
 extension for your output file, this will result in an scalar dataset named
 epsilon stored using the legacy VTK file format in the Cell Data section
 of the output file.
 Note that this output consists of the squared values of the local residuals,
 so further post-processing will be necessary.
