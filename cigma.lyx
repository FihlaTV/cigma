\begin_layout Section
About Cigma
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CIG Model Analyzer (Cigma) consists of a suite of tools for comparing
 numerical models.
 CIG has developed Cigma in response to demand from the short-term tectonics
 community for a simple tool that can perform rigorous error analysis on
 their finite element codes.
 The long-term goal for Cigma, however, is for it to be used for nearly
 all geodynamics modeling codes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current version of Cigma is intended for the calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 residuals for finite element models.
 This software was designed for performing the following three main tasks:
 (1) error analysis, (2) benchmarking, and (3) code verification.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In error analysis, Cigma can calculate a global measure of the error between
 two solutions by performing an integration over a discretized version of
 the common domain.
 This comparison can take place even when the underlying discretizations
 do not overlap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In benchmarking, Cigma can help the geodynamics community agree on a standard
 solution to specific problems by facilitating the process of comparing
 different numerical codes against each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, as an automated tool, Cigma can help application developers create
 regression tests to ensure that software changes do not affect the consistency
 of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At its core, Cigma draws from a variety of libraries.
 The 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl
name "FInite element Automatic Tabulator (FIAT)"
target "www.fenics.org/wiki/FIAT"

\end_inset

 Python Library supports generation of arbitrary order instances of the
 Lagrange elements on lines, triangles, and tetrahedra.
 It can also generate order instances of Jacobi-type quadrature rules on
 the same element shapes.
 The 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl
name "Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)"
target "www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/"

\end_inset

 Library, written in C++, supports data structures and algorithms for both
 exact and nearest-neighbor searching in arbitrarily high dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these libraries particularly extend and generalize Cigma's functionality
 so it can handle other types of elements, and provide the ability to compare
 vector fields.

Error Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When studying differential equations that represent physical systems we
 often obtain solutions by using a variety of techniques.
 Solving these equations using classical analytical methods is almost impossible
, so we often resort to numerical algorithms such as the finite element
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For assessing the quality of the solution to our equations, it is important
 to quantify the error in our numerical solutions.
 To calculate this error, we will have to compare tentative solutions against
 each other through the use of a distance measure between two functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Distance Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest possible quantitative measure of the difference between two
 distinct fields you can make consists of taking the pointwise difference
 of both fields at a common set of points.
 While no finite sample of points can perfectly represent a continuum of
 values, valuable information can be inferred from a statistics analysis
 of the resulting set of differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps a more useful distance measure can be obtained by using the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 norm, defined by the following integral
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\varepsilon=||u-v||_{L_{2}}=\sqrt{\int_{\Omega}||u(\vec{x})-v(\vec{x})||^{2}d\vec{x}}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This gives us a single global estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 representing the distance between the two fields 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, you may think of this as the size, or norm, of the residual
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\vec{x})=u(\vec{x})-v(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we discretize the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 into finite elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

, the above integral can be broken up into a sum over local contributions
 on each element.
 For efficiency, each contribution can be integrated over a reference element
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Omega}_{e}$
\end_inset

 defined on a standard coordinate system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon^{2} & = & \sum_{e=1}^{\mathrm{nel}}\varepsilon_{e}^{2}\\
 & = & \sum_{e=1}^{\mathrm{nel}}\int_{\Omega_{e}}||u(\vec{x})-v(\vec{x})||^{2}d\vec{x}\\
 & = & \sum_{e=1}^{\mathrm{nel}}\int_{\hat{\Omega}_{e}}||u(\vec{\xi})-v(\vec{\xi})||^{2}J(\vec{\xi})d\vec{\xi}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, we won't be able to integrate each local contribution exactly
 since the two fields 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 may have a representation that is incompatible with the local domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

.
 However, we can approximate each 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 by applying an appropriate quadrature rule with a tolerable truncation
 error 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Encyclopaedia of Cubature Formulas 2005"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Global Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming we apply the same quadrature rule, with weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{q}$
\end_inset

 and integration points 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\xi}_{q}$
\end_inset

, on every element,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon_{e}^{2} & = & \sum_{q=1}^{\mathrm{nq}}w_{q}||\hat{\rho}(\vec{x}_{q})||^{2}\\
 & = & \sum_{q=1}^{\mathrm{nq}}w_{q}||u(\vec{\xi}_{q})-v(\vec{\xi}_{q})||^{2}J(\vec{\xi}_{q})\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
thus we arrive at the final form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon & = & \sqrt{\sum_{e=1}^{\mathrm{nel}}\sum_{q=1}^{\mathrm{nq}}w_{q}||u(\vec{\xi}_{q})-v(\vec{\xi}_{q})||^{2}J(\vec{\xi}_{q})}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In calculating the norm of the residual field 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, Cigma will output each of the local contributions 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{e}^{2}$
\end_inset

 which by definition are scalar-valued cell quantities over each of their
 corresponding elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Comparing Residuals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For comparing errors of different solutions, you can normalize the global
 error by the norm of the exact solution.
 This normalized error is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon_{rel} & = & \frac{||u-u^{h}||_{L_{2}}}{||u||_{L_{2}}}\\
 & = & \frac{\int_{\Omega}||u(\vec{x})-u^{h}(\vec{x})||^{2}d\vec{x}}{\int_{\Omega}||u(\vec{x})||^{2}d\vec{x}}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This normalized error can be interpreted as the average error in the physical
 quantity being evaluated, so that a value of 0.01 corresponds to a 1% averaged
 error.
 The norm in the denominator can be computed in Cigma by comparing against
 the built-in zero function (see Section 4.2.4) (TODO: make into reference)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if the exact solution is not currently known, this normalized error
 may be used to test the accuracy between two or more numerical solutions,
 defined on successively refined meshes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Input and Output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The underlying data storage format for Cigma is the HDF5 format, due to
 its flexibility for storing and organizing large amounts of data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is a portable file format developed at
 the 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl
name "National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)"
target "hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5"

\end_inset

.
 It is designed for storing, retrieving, analyzing, visualizing, and converting
 scientific data.
 The current and most popular version is HDF5, which stores multi-dimensional
 arrays together with ancillary data in a portable self-describing format.
 It uses a hierarchical structure that provides application programmers
 with a host of options for organizing how data is stored in HDF5 files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using HDF5 datasets in Cigma allows us to avoid having to convert between
 too many distinct formats.
 Moreover, due to the amount of disk I/O, large finite element meshes can
 be handled more efficiently in binary format.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cigma also supports the popular VTK format for certain kinds of input.
 A simple text format is also supported to aid in debugging.
 As described in Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:Running-Cigma"

\end_inset

, you can easily examine the structure of an input file by using the 
\family typewriter
cigma list
\family default
 command, which will simply reveal the names and dimensions of all datasets
 inside the specified file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Cigma, we define a finite element mesh simply by coordinates, 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{n},y_{n},z_{n})$
\end_inset

 of its degrees of freedom, and the connectivity relations 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{e}=\{n_{1},n_{2},\ldots\}$
\end_inset

 among them which define each individual element in the corresponding discretiza
tion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the evaluation points on two distinct meshes will (TODO -- will do
 what?), it is very important to index the location of each element into
 spatial data structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A field is a function which assigns a physical quantity to every point in
 space.
 This quantity may correspond to a scalar, a vector, or even a tensor.
 A finite element approximation to an unknown field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

 is simply the weighed sum over a fixed set of localized shape functions
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{n}(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi(\vec{x})=\sum_{n=1}^{N}d_{n}\phi_{n}(\vec{x})\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Naturally, once the weights 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

, or degrees of freedom as they are also called, are known to us, we can
 evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

 at any point 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 we desire.
 Thus, in Cigma a field is represented simply by a list of degrees of freedom
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{n}$
\end_inset

, which may be a scalar, vector or tensor quantity, depending on the nature
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Elements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common element types used in the finite element method are given
 by the following shape functions, defined on their respective domains,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\end_layout

HN_{e} & = & \frac{1}{8}\left(1-x\right)\left(1-y\right)\left(1+z\right)\\
HN_{f} & = & \frac{1}{8}\left(1+x\right)\left(1-y\right)\left(1+z\right)\\
HN_{g} & = & \frac{1}{8}\left(1-x\right)\left(1+y\right)\left(1+z\right)\\
HN_{h} & = & \frac{1}{8}\left(1+x\right)\left(1+y\right)\left(1+z\right)\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are built-in elements in Cigma, and you may refer to them by name
 in the FunctionSpace metadata attribute on your datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Higher order elements can also be used by specifying an explicit tabulation
 matrix representing the values of your shape functions on the corresponding
 set of quadrature points.

\begin_layout Section
Comparing Two Fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing two arbitrary finite element fields can be accomplished with the
 
\family typewriter
cigma compare
\family default
 command-line utility.
 By default, the comparison will take place over the elements in the mesh
 of the first field.
 Finally, the square of each of the local residual values are written to
 the specified VTK output file as cell-based scalars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A basic comparison can be as simple as specifying the following arguments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare --output=squared-residuals.vtk
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\series bold
 
\series default
             --first=field1.h5:/field1/stepN

             --second=field2.h5:/field2/stepN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Specifying a Mesh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To override the mesh used in the integration, you can specify an extra argument
 providing the location of the mesh:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --mesh=mesh.h5:/model/mesh/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also specify the coordinates and connectivity arrays separately,
 in case they reside in separate files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --mesh-coordinates=file1.h5:/model/mesh/coordinates
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --mesh-connectivity=file2.h5:/model/mesh/connectivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Specifying a Quadrature Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To specify a quadrature rule, you will have to provide the quadrature weights
 and points in the appropriate reference element.
 This can be done with the following additional argument:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --rule=quadrature-rules.h5:/path/to/rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also specify the location of the points and weights separately:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --rule-points=file.h5:/path/to/rule/points
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  --rule-weights=file.h5:/path/to/rule/weights
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparing against Known Values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A finite element description might not always be available for one of the
 fields.
 However, you can break the comparison into several steps if you have a
 means to compute that field on any of the required points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, extract the global coordinates of the integration points.
 This will result in an explicit list of points over which to evaluate your
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma extract --mesh=field1.h5:/model/mesh/
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              --output=points.h5:/points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you can evaluate your function at the designated points.
 You can provide the path to the explicit set of values with
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare --output=squared-residuals.vtk
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              --first=field1.h5:/field1/stepN
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
              --second=values.h5:/stepN_values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparing against a Known Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one of your fields is easily described by an analytic expression, then
 you also have the option to compile your analytic function into Cigma,
 which will enable the 
\family typewriter
compare
\family default
 command to reference your function by name:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cigma compare --output=squared-residuals.vtk
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\series bold
 
\series default
             --first=field1.h5:/vars/displacement/step0

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also interact with your analytic function by using the 
\family typewriter
cigma
\family default
 
\family typewriter
eval
\family default
 command, and obtain a set of values which may then be passed back to the
 
\family typewriter
compare
\family default
 command.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Chapter
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the exact solution of your equations is known, the norm of the error
 for a finite element solution is easily computed through the procedure
 given in Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:Error-Analysis"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way of checking the accuracy of a solution is by rerunning the same
 problem with a finer mesh.
 Recall that in the finite element method, the weight functions and trial
 solutions are chosen so that the finite element method is convergent.
 In other words, as the element size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 decreases, the solution tends to the correct solution.
 Thus, if the difference between the coarse and fine mesh solutions is small,
 we can conclude that the coarse mesh solution is quite accurate.
 However, if a solution changes noticeably with refinement of the mesh,
 the coarse mesh solution is inaccurate, and even the finer mesh may be
 inadequate as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Convergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To demonstrate the convergence in the FEM method, in this example we will
 compare the error incurred in representing a continuous function by finite
 elements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can change the function by modifying the the 
\family typewriter
TestFunction.cpp
\family default
 source file.
 Once you recompile cigma, you will be able to refer to it by the name 
\family typewriter
\bar under
test
\family default
\bar default
 when using the 
\family typewriter
cigma eval
\family default
 command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the test directory you will find a series of successively refined meshes
 that you can use for testing.
 The original mesh files were created with the Gmsh, a three-dimensional
 finite element mesh generator, but you will be accessing the HDF5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the figure (TODO: regenerate plot), we show the log of the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 error norm as a function of the log of the element size 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen from these results, the log of the error varies linearly
 with element size and the slope depends on the order of the element.
 Denoting the slope by 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, then the error in the function can be expressed as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\log\varepsilon=\log C+\alpha\log h\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\log C$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary constant, the y-intercept of the curve.
 The slope 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the rate of convergence of the element.
 We can rewrite this as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\varepsilon=Ch^{\alpha}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Different Element Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this example we will use sample datasets from the strike-slip benchmark
 case defined by the CIG Short-Term Tectonics working group.
 In this benchmark problem, we solve for the viscoelastic relaxation of
 stresses from a single finite earthquake while ignoring gravity.
 The problem is defined on a cube domain with sides of 24 km consisting
 of two layers of different material types.
 The top layer of the cube is nearly elastic, while the bottom layer is
 viscoelastic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Comparing Two Codes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example, we will compare various codes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Analytic Comparison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(TODO: ask brad for his okada soln HDF5 file and link to it here)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the analytic solution is known, we may use it directly when specifying
 a field argument to the 
\family typewriter
cigma compare
\family default
 command, although this will require you to register your function as a
 built-in field.
 To demonstrate this capability, the current version of Cigma includes 
\family typewriter
disloc3d
\family default
 as a built-in field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(TODO: rerun these commands)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
$cigma eval --function=disloc3d --output=tet4_1000m_qpts_displacement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, you can also extract the required list of points on which
 you need to evaluate the exact solution.
 We can do this for the Pylith mesh in the previous section with the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ cigma extract
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    --mesh=strikeslip.h5:/tet4_1000m/mesh/
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    --output=tet4_1000m_qpts.h5:/tet4_1000m_qpts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can now take the list of points in a global coordinate system, and apply
 your function.
 For demonstration purposes, we can use the disloc3d built-in function.
 The comparison can then take place
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ cigma compare  
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    --first=strikeslip.h5:/tet4_1000m/displacement/step0000
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    --second=okada_solution.h5:/tet4_1000m_qpts_displacement

Here, we have taken the

File Formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To differentiate between these formats, you will need to provide an appropriate
 extension for your input and output files.
 The supported extensions are currently 
\family typewriter
.h5
\family default
 for HDF5, 
\family typewriter
.vtk
\family default
 for VTK files, and 
\family typewriter
.txt
\family default
 for simple text files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Input File Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are about six different objects you will want to use as input to cigma,
 all of which can be represented as two-dimensional datasets.
 These are the 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
mesh coordinates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
mesh connectivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
field coefficients (degrees of freedom)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
quadrature rule points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
quadrature rule weights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
shape function tabulation matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
HDF5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HDF5 files are organized in a hierarchical structure, similar to a UNIX
 file system.
 Two types of primary objects, groups and datasets, are stored in this structure.
 A group contains instances of zero or more groups or datasets, while a
 dataset stores a multi-dimensional array of data elements.
 Both kinds of objects are accompanied by supporting metadata known as attribute
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dataset is physically stored in two parts: a header and a data array.
 The header contains miscellaneous metadata describing the dataset as well
 as information that is needed to interpret the array portion of the dataset.
 Essentially, it includes the name, datatype, dataspace, and storage layout
 of the dataset.
 The name is a text string identifying the dataset.
 The datatype describes the type of the data array elements.
 The dataspace defines the dimensionality of the dataset, i.e., the size and
 shape of the multi-dimensional array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Cigma you always provide an explicit path to every dataset, so you have
 a fair amount of flexibility for how you organize your datasets inside
 HDF5 files.
 For example, a typical Cigma HDF5 file could have the following structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
model.h5
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
__ model
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, Cigma will only require you to specify the path to a specific
 field dataset.
 If a small amount of metadata is present in your field dataset, the rest
 of the required information, such as which mesh and finite elements to
 use, will be deduced from that metadata.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
MeshID an identifier assigned for use in linking child datasets to their
 parent mesh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
MeshLocation points to the HDF5 group which contains the appropriate coordinates
 and connectivity datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
FunctionSpace string identifier to determine which shape functions to use
 for interpolating values inside the element (e.g., tet4, hex8, quad4, tri3,
 ...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DatasetType string identifier for classifying the type of data contained
 in the dataset (e.g., points, connectivity, degrees of freedom, quadrature
 rules, global quadrature points, global field values).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
VTK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current version of Cigma only supports VTK unstructured grid datasets
 of a single element type.
 You can still compare various unstructured grids with different element
 types to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that while you typically provide a path (or name) for every dataset,
 this is not necessary when specifying a VTK mesh, since this data is taken
 from the special Points and Cells arrays, which you cannot rename.
 However, you will still need to provide a name when referring to the shape
 function coefficients, which are assumed to be stored as Point Data in
 the input VTK file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more information, you may want to refer to Visualization ToolKit's 
\begin_inset LatexCommand htmlurl

\end_inset

 document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The text format is always in table form, with the dimensions of the table
 specified in the first line.
 For example, mesh coordinates can be specified in the following format
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
nno nsd
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
x1 y1 z1
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A generic field with

 components (i.e., scalar, vector, or tensor) is specified by
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
num ndim
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
f1 f2 f3 ..
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
f1 f2 f3 ..
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this last case, the number of rows could refer to either 
\family typewriter
nno
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
nel
\family default
, depending on whether the field is node-based or cell-based.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Output File Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output format for residuals consists simply of a list of scalars for
 each element in the discretization.
 If you specify a 
\family typewriter
.vtk
\family default
 extension for your output file, this will result in an scalar dataset named
 epsilon stored using the legacy VTK file format in the Cell Data section
 of the output file.
 Note that this output consists of the squared values of the local residuals,
 so further post-processing will be necessary.

 then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
 distribute them as separate works.
 But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
 work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the
 terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
 the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
 rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
 the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
 based on the Program.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
 the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
 or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
 this License.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
 which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
 a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
 any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
 source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
 source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
 on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
 corresponding source code.
 (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only
 if you received the program in object code or executable form with such
 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it.
 For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code
 for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
 plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
 However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
 with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
 system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
 to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
 the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
 code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
 with the object code.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
 expressly provided under this License.
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
 is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
 Program or its derivative works.
 These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
 Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based
 on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
 and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
 the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
 to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise
 of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
 License.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
 or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
 imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict
 the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
 of this License.
 If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
 under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
 you may not distribute the Program at all.
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
 of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
 you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would
 be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
 or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
 this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
 software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.
 Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
 distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
 that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
 that choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
 a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
 either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
 holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographic
al distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution
 is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
 In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
 the body of this License.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
 may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
 to it and "any later version," you have the option of following the terms
 and conditions either of that version or of any later version published
 by the Free Software Foundation.
 If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
 choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
 whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask
 for permission.
 For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write
 to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
 Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
 reuse of software generally.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
 which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
 It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivel
y convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
 Copyright 
\size footnotesize
Â© (
\size default
year) (name of author) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
 under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
 Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
 any later version.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
 ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
 FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 See the GNU General Public License for more details.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
 with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
 it starts in an interactive mode: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright Â© year name of author Gnomovision comes
 with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
 conditions; type `show c' for details.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.
 Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show
 w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items -- whatever
 suits your program.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
 Here is a sample; alter the names: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovisi
on' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

\begin_layout Standard
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.
 If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful
 to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.
 If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License
 instead of this License.
